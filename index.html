				<h4 class="about-club">Welcome to Columbia College Chicago's only Web Dev Club</h4>
				<p class="about-club">We're brewing a digital alchemy that transforms creativity into interactive magic. Columbia College Chicago doesn't have a web development major, so we're taking matters into our own hands. We're building a community where artists can learn code, and the programming major's can have more fun with art. </p>

				<div class="about-club">
					<h4>Our Formula:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Each meeting starts with a theme <i>( ex: under the sea, leapard print, outer space, etc )</i></li>
						<li>For the next hour, we start coding in HTML or CSS and we usually eat whatever we ordered for catering.</li>
						<li>We wrap up by sharing to the group <i>( or we put you in partners when there's too many of you. )</i></li>
					</ul>
